If I have to start a software company, I would like to start it with Kushagra Joshi and Anurag as my partners. This is because we are from the same batch and have an excellent understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. We are aware of the knowledge that we each have and can understand and analyze each other's programs very well. Also, Kushagra and Anurag both are very knowledgeable and hardworking Full-Stack Web Developers. Since we took training together we can spot each other's errors in the program very easily, I think we make a good team.
